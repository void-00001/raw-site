Consuming can make a person more knowledgable. There is value in knowledge. But there can be no positive change until you create.

Distraction is fear. Recognize it in you, feel it, spend a moment with it, thank it and then choose the other path. Do! Create, engage and help.

When you consume, put your intention into love and be with yourself, whole and aware. Otherwise put your intention into love, and do.

We need you.
