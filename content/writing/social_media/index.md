Do you ever think that using social media, or what I like to call "stupid media", from a tiny corner of your room makes you a step away from society or being social? Think about it, you're wasting hours of your precious life scrolling through feeds, liking and commenting on posts that are utterly irrelevant to your existence.

I mean, no, why should I think about it? Mind your own business, I use these platforms just for fun, I enjoy scrolling through my phone screen... But let's be real, we both know that's just a lie. We're all addicted to the constant stream of information, and we're too afraid to admit it.

But after reading this paragraph, if it makes you feel joyful, bruh, you've been destroyed. The truth is, you're not human, you don't have a human brain to use it in the right way, you just think about scrolling all day or all week thinking that "social media" makes you joyful. You're sacrificing your real life for the sake of likes and followers.

And let's not even get started on the so-called "influencers" who make a living off of promoting products they've never even used. They're like the pied pipers of the digital age, leading us all down the rabbit hole of consumerism and superficiality.

You have to be real to be social and these awful media's community, I don't think it's a community because it shouldn't exist in real life. We're all just a bunch of lonely souls stuck in our own little worlds, desperate for validation and connection.

Oh, a boy is scared of his account being hacked. Bro, who really cares about you and that stupid media's account you have? Are you really that attached to your online identity?

I'm just tired of saying or suggesting all these things to become more real and social, along with not using social media platforms. But who cares? It's just me at the end... I'm the one who's been awake for 24 hours straight, staring at the ceiling, wondering what the point of it all is.

If you're scrolling and reading this mysterious writing, look outside your window, don't hesitate, go for a walk. Already gone? Cool, that's what a real human being does. And also, see how awful it is if you don't delete social media, I'll have to come myself again to take you out of the room...

You know I'm not kidding.
