<pre><code>      When I was done dying,
      my conscious regained
      So I began the struggle,
      a nothingness strained
                - Dan Deacon
</code></pre>
<p>In the dimly lit corridors of Westbrook High, a tale of resilience and redemption unfolded, centering around a girl named Gai. Gai’s story was unlike any other, marked by the haunting shadows of tragedy and the relentless pursuit of a second chance. Gai had faced death not once, but twice, in the unforgiving twists of fate that shaped her life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The wound is the place where the Light enters you.&rdquo; Amidst the chaos of her emotions, Gai draws strength from the wisdom of Rumi. This profound insight reminds her that even in her darkest moments, there is the potential for healing and transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time was in a devastating car accident that left her clinging to the edge of life, her body battered and broken. Miraculously, she survived, but the scars, both physical and emotional, ran deep. Haunted by the trauma of the accident, Gai struggled to find her footing in a world that suddenly seemed alien and hostile. Her once bright spirit dimmed as she grappled with survivor’s guilt and the crushing weight of what could have been.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Gai grapples with survivor&rsquo;s guilt and grief, she finds solace in the words of Maya Angelou. These words become a guiding light, inspiring her to persevere through the pain and emerge stronger than before.</p>
<p>But just as Gai began to piece together the fragments of her shattered existence, tragedy struck again. This time, it was the unexpected loss of her closest friend, a soul who had stood by her through the darkest of days.The pain of grief threatened to consume her, dragging her down into the depths of despair.</p>
<p>In her quest to spread hope and kindness, Gai embodies the sentiment of Mahatma Gandhi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Be the change that you wish to see in the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With each act of compassion, she becomes a catalyst for positive change, inspiring others to follow in her footsteps and make a difference in their own communities.</p>
<p>Yet, amid the suffocating darkness, Gai found a flicker of light—a beacon of hope that refused to be extinguished. It was in the embrace of her community, the outpouring of love and support from friends and family, that Gai discovered the strength to rise from the ashes of her despair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What doesn&rsquo;t kill me makes me stronger.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through her journey of overcoming adversity and embracing the fullness of life, she discovers the depths of her own courage and the boundless power of the human spirit.</p>
